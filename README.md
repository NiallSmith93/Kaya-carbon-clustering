# Kaya-carbon-clustering

The Kaya identity is an equation which expresses total carbon dioxide emissions as a product of population, GDP, energy consumption and carbon intensity of energy supply. This project aims to group or cluster countries globally according to characteristics of the Kaya identity, using several techiniques. Specifically, EDA and clustering will be performed on a dataset of 165 countries containing the variables of energy use per capita, CO2 emissions per capita, and gross domestic product per capita, all for the year 2015.

Data for energy use and GDP are sourced from the World Bank, while data for carbon emissions are sourced from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research.
